Controls
========

Move around with WSAD, shift, and space, look around with mouse motion.
Mouse button 1 deletes the block you're pointing at, button 2 selects it
as the active block, and button 3 places the active block next to the one
you're pointing at.

As an alternative to picking, you can also use the mousewheel up/down to
flip through available blocks.

Q changes the face of the active block (loops over up, down, right, left,
front, and back) and E changes the turn (none, left, around, and right).

Pressing B prints details about the block you're pointing at and P prints
info about the active block. L spits out the player position and light
level there. C dumps info about the chunk of the pointed at block.

Press N to toggle player/world collision.

F1 toggles UI rendering.
F3 toggles a display telling how long on average it takes to compute a frame.
F4 toggles audio.
