Arguments
=========

Runtime
-------

-n <n>
	terminate after <n> frames

-t <t>
	terminate after <t> milliseconds

if both n and t are given, terminate after n frames and
assume <t> milliseconds pass each frame

--asset-path <path>
	load assets from given path
	default is application dir + "assets"

--save-path <path>
	store and load saves at given path
	default is whatever SDL thinks is good
	(should be ~/.local/share/localhorst/blank/)

Application
-----------

-d
	disable double buffering

-m <num>
	set sample size to <num> (samples per pixel)

--no-vsync
	disable vsync

--standalone
	run as standalone (the default)

--client
	run as client

--server
	run as server

Interface
---------

--no-keyboard
	disable keyboard input handling

--no-mouse
	disable mouse input handling

--no-hud
	disable HUD drawing (includes the selected block outline)

--no-audio
	disable audio
	the audio device and sounds will still be allocated
	it just stops the interface from queueing buffers

Network
-------

--host <hostname>
	hostname to connect to in client mode

--port <number>
	port number to connection to (client) or listen on (server)

World
-----

-s <seed>
	use <seed> (unsigned integer) as the world seed
	only used for newly created worlds
	default is 0

--world-name <name>
	use given name for the world save
	no checks are being done right now, so make sure it can be
	used as a directory name


Controls
========

Move around with WSAD, shift, and space, look around with mouse motion.
Mouse button 1 deletes the block you're pointing at, button 2 selects it
as the active block, and button 3 places the active block next to the one
you're pointing at.

As an alternative to picking, you can also use the mousewheel up/down to
flip through available blocks.

Q changes the face of the active block (loops over up, down, right, left,
front, and back) and E changes the turn (none, left, around, and right).

Pressing B prints details about the block you're pointing at and P prints
info about the active block. L spits out the player position and light
level there. C dumps info about the chunk of the pointed at block.

Press N to toggle player/world collision.

F1 toggles UI rendering.
F3 toggles a display telling how long on average it takes to compute a frame.
F4 toggles audio.

Controls are interpreted by scancode, meaning you don't have to break your
fingers when you're on an AZERTY. WSAD will be ZSQD there and the above
description is just wrong.

Also I've added a plethora of alternate keys that can be used, like arrow
keys for movement, ins/del for placing/removing blocks, etc.
