I want to thank:

Glenn Fiedler
	for his excellent series on game programming in general and
	networked physics in particular. The site is
	http://gafferongames.com/ and I can highly recommend his articles.

Stefan Gustavson
	for his implementation of simplex noise. The one I'm using doesn't
	resemble much of his original due to language adaptation,
	customization, and optimization, but I started out from his and
	it's working nicely.

The libnoise Project
	despite not using their library I have learned a lot about noise
	and terrain generation there. The library as well as documentation
	can be found on sourceforge: http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/

The Folks at http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/
	I made my first steps with OpenGL following this tutorial (and this
	very project, as one can witness in earlier commits) and from there
	acquired the rest through reading their sources and the OpenGL
	documentation itself.
