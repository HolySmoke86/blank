release (default), debug, profile:
	build executables tuned for running, debugging, and profiling

run:
	build and execute the main binary with state path set to ./saves

server:
	same as run, only in server mode

server:
	same as run, only in client mode and the save path is set to
	./client-saved to prevent clashes with a running `make server`

test:
	build and run unittests

gdb, cachegrind, callgrind:
	build the binary suited for given tool and launch

clean:
	remove intermediates

distclean:
	remove intermediates and artifacts
	(also those generated by tool invocations!)
