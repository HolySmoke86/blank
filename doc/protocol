Structure
=========

Offset  Size   Type  Description
 0      4      data  protocol tag, must be 0xFB1AB1AF
 4      2      uint  sequence number
 6      2      uint  sequence ack
 8      4      data  bitfield with previous acks
12      1      uint  type code for the payload
13      3      none  padding, reserved for future use
16      0-484  data  payload, contents and length vary,
                     mostly depending on the type code

all multibyte values are in LE
the current code does no conversion, so only works on machines
with native LE (or BE if the server and all clients are on that,
but that's by accident and will break if conversion code is ever
added)

Common Types
------------

Name          Size  Type
vec3          12    3x 32bit float
vec3i         12    3x 32bit signed int
vec3b          3    3x 8bit signed int
packn          2    16bit signed int representing a float value normalized to [-1,1]
                    	it can be unpacked by dividing by 32767
packu          2    16bit unsigned  int representing a float value normalized to [0,1]
                    	it can be unpacked by dividing by 65535
vec3n          6    3x packn
vec3u          6    3x packu
quat           8    2bit index of largest component, a 2bit padding, then 3x 20bit small components in xyzw
                    	order mapped from [-0.7072,0.7072] to [0,1048574] (with largest omitted)
entity state  42    [ 0] vec3i chunk pos (there's a variation where this is a vec3b)
                    [12] vec3u block pos by 16,
                    [18] vec3 velocity,
                    [30] quat orientation,
                    [38] packn pitch by PI/2
					[40] packn yaw by PI
