Structure
=========

Offset  Size   Type  Description
 0      4      data  protocol tag, must be 0xFB1AB1AF
 4      2      uint  sequence number
 6      2      uint  sequence ack
 8      4      data  bitfield with previous acks
12      1      uint  type code for the payload
13      3      none  padding, reserved for future use
16      0-484  data  payload, contents and length vary,
                     mostly depending on the type code

all multibyte values are in LE
the current code does no conversion, so only works on machines
with native LE (or BE if the server and all clients are on that,
but that's by accident and will break if conversion code is ever
added)
