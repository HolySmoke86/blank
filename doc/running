assume <t> milliseconds pass each frame

--asset-path <path>
	load assets from given path
	default is application dir + "assets"

--save-path <path>
	store and load saves at given path
	default is whatever SDL thinks is good

	only used for newly created worlds
	default is 0

--world-name <name>
	use given name for the world save

Controls
========

Move around with WSAD, shift, and space, look around with mouse motion.
Mouse button 1 deletes the block you're pointing at, button 2 selects it
as the active block, and button 3 places the active block next to the one
you're pointing at.

As an alternative to picking, you can also use the mousewheel up/down to
flip through available blocks or access the first 10 via the number keys.

F1 toggles UI rendering.
F2 toggles world rendering.
F3 toggles the debug overlay.
F4 toggles audio.
F5 toggles camera mode.

Controls are interpreted by scancode, meaning you don't have to break your
fingers when you're on an AZERTY. WSAD will be ZSQD there and the above
description is just wrong.

Also I've added a plethora of alternate keys that can be used, like arrow
keys for movement, ins/del for placing/removing blocks, etc.
